== Introduction

The Gravitee Kubernetes Operator is a new technical component which has to be deployed into a Kubernetes Cluster.
It aims to meet several objectives:

*API Management*: 

  * manage CRDs for defining / deploying and publishing APIs, Applications, etc.
  * act as an Ingress Controller for deploying Ingresses to the API Gateway

*Platform*: 

  * manage CRDs for deploying Gravitee products (APIM, AM, AE, â€¦)

One of the main goal of this new component is also to cover the CICD aspects when it comes to Kubernetes.

== How-to run locally
