== Introduction

APIM 3.19.0 has introduced the BETA release of the Gravitee Kubernetes Operator (GKO) - a new technical component designed to be deployed on an existing APIM-ready Kubernetes Cluster. It can also be deployed on a local cluster for testing purposes.

You can use the GKO to define, deploy, and publish APIs to your API Portal and API Gateway and to manage Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) as part of the process.

In future releases, the GKO will support additional functionality to enable the following:

  * Using the GKO as an Ingress Controller for deploying Ingresses to an API Gateway.
  * Deploying Gravitee products (API Management, Access Management, Alert Engine).
  * Improving automation processes through covering CICD aspects when using Kubernetes with APIM.
  * Managing most API Management resources without directly relying on the Console or on the Management API.

NOTE: The GKO is currently in BETA and only works with APIM version 3.19.0 (and above). Version 1.0 (GA) is planned for the end of 2022 as part of the release of APIM 3.20.0. Until then, the source code will continue to be subject to further development, which could result in breaking changes - please do not use in production.

== User documentation

You can find detailed information about the Gravitee Kubernetes Operator in the following sections of the Gravitee user documentation:

  * link:https://docs.gravitee.io/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_overview.html[Overview^]
  * link:https://docs.gravitee.io/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_architecture.html[Architecture^]

  * link:https://docs.gravitee.io/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_user_guide.html[User Guide^]

The GKO API reference documentation is available https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/api/reference.md[here].

== Developer guide

=== Initialize your environment

* Install link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker^]
* Install link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl^]
* Install link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm^]
* Install link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/[NodeJs^]
* Install the operator-sdk: `brew install operator-sdk`

=== Install tooling for development

All the tool needed to run the make targets used during development can be installed by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make install-tools
----

To get more information about the available make targets, run:

[source,shell]
----
make help
----

=== Run the operator locally

To run the operator locally against an APIM-ready link:https://k3d.io/[k3d^] cluster, run the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Initialize a local kubernetes cluster running APIM
make k3d-init

# Install the operator CRDs into the cluster
make install

# Run the operator controller on your local machine
make run
----

=== Debug the operator and APIM

To be able to run the operator against a local instance of both an APIM Gateway and an APIM Management API, you will need to:

* Attach to a local cluster context.
* Create a local service account to authenticate the gateway against the local cluster.
* Create an API Context pointing to your local APIM Management API.
* Run what you need to debug in debug mode.

[source,shell]
----
# Create a service account token with 'cluster-admin' role in the current context and
# use this token to authenticate against the current cluster
make k3d-admin

make run # or run using a debugger if you need to debug the operator as well

# Create the debug Management Context resource for APIM
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/context/debug/api-context-with-credentials.yml

# Create a basic API Definition resource
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/apim/api-with-context.yml
----

=== Run the operator as a deployment on the k3d cluster

Some features and behaviors of the operator can only be tested when running it as a deployment on the k3d cluster.

This is a case for e.g. for link:https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/webhook/[webhooks^] or 
when testing the operator deployed in multiple namespaces.

You can deploy the operator on your k3d cluster by running the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
make k3d-build k3d-push k3d-deploy
----

=== Working with the repo

When committing your contributions, please follow link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[conventional commits^] and semantic release best practices.

=== Release process

/!\ All new changes should be committed to the `alpha` branch.

To create a new release, we need to merge `alpha` into `master`. 
A github action do the job. 

Go in the `Actions` tab and select the `Trigger Release` workflow. Run it with the following parameters:

* `Source branch`: `alpha`
* `Target branch`: `master`

A new release is automatically created on `master` and a new tag is pushed. When a new tag is pushed, a github action `Sync Branches` is triggered to rebase `alpha` on `master`.

== Troubleshooting

=== Local Docker image registry

The k3d registry host used to share images between your host and your k3d cluster is defined as `k3d-graviteeio.docker.localhost`. On most linux / macos platforms, `*.localhost`` should resolve to 127.0.0.1. If this is not the case on your device, you need to add the following entry in your `/etc/hosts` file:

[source,shell]
----
127.0.0.1 k3d-graviteeio.docker.localhost
----
