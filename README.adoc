== Introduction

The Gravitee Kubernetes Operator (GKO) is a new technical component which has to be deployed into a Kubernetes Cluster.
It aims to meet several objectives:

*API Management*: 

  * manage CRDs for defining / deploying and publishing APIs, Applications, etc.
  * act as an Ingress Controller for deploying Ingresses to the API Gateway

*Platform*: 

  * manage CRDs for deploying Gravitee products (APIM, AM, AE, â€¦)

One of the main goal of this new component is also to cover the CICD aspects when it comes to Kubernetes.

== How-to run locally
To run the operator locally, against an APIM ready K3d cluster, execute the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
make k3d-apim-init

make install

# should return apidefinitions.gravitee.io and managementcontexts.gravitee.io
kubectl get crd 

make run
----

== Try it
To create a basic api definition run following command

[source,shell]
----
# Create a management context for your APIM instance running on K3D
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/context/managementcontext_credentials_k3d.yaml

# Create a basic API definition resource
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/apim/basic-example-with-ctx.yml

kubectl get graviteeapis  -o wide
# NAME                ID                                     ENTRYPOINT   ENDPOINT                       VERSION   ENABLED
# basic-api-example   ff3549c9-ceb2-36da-87f7-f5e51ba89097   /k8s-basic   https://api.gravitee.io/echo   1.0       true

== Debugging with a locally running APIM
To be abble to run the operator against a local instance of both APIM Gateway and APIM Management API you will need to
  - Attach to a local cluster context
  - Create a local service account to authenticate the gateway against the local cluster
  - Run both APIM Gateway and APIM Management API in debug mode
  - Create a management context pointing to your local APIM management API

[source,shell]
----
make install

# should return apidefinitions.gravitee.io and managementcontexts.gravitee.io
kubectl get crd 

make run # or run using a debugger if you need to debug the operator as well

# Create a management context for APIM
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/context/managementcontext_credentials.yaml

# Create a basic API definition resource
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/apim/basic-example-with-ctx.yml
----

== Deploying GKO as a k3d deployment

This will publish your docker image to the k3d cluster registry and deploy the operator
in a dedicated `gko-system` namespace

[source,shell]
----
make k3d-gko-build k3d-gko-push k3d-gko-deploy
----

== Note for Apple Silicon users
The default version of kustomize installed by the `kustomize` target is not available on
arm64 platforms.

You can override the version to use setting the `KUSTOMIZE_VERSION` environment variable

[source,shell]
----
export KUSTOMIZE_VERSION=v4.5.5
make kustomize
----
